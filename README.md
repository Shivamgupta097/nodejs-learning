### 📌 What is Node.js?

Node.js is a **JavaScript runtime** built on **Chrome's V8 engine**.  
It allows JavaScript to run **outside the browser**, such as on:

- Servers  
- IoT devices  
- Smartwatches  
- And more

### 📖 History of Node.js

- Created in **2009** by **Ryan Dahl**, initially using **Mozilla's SpiderMonkey** engine.
- After 2 days, he switched to **Google’s V8 engine** and never looked back.
- Originally named **Web.js**, but later renamed to **Node.js** by Ryan.

#### ❓ Why Node.js was created:

- Traditional servers like **Apache HTTP Server** had **blocking I/O**.
- Node.js introduced **non-blocking I/O**, making it more efficient for handling multiple requests.

#### 🚀 Milestones:

- Sponsored by **Joyent** (where Ryan worked), which helped Node.js grow.
- **2010**: **NPM (Node Package Manager)** was created by **Isaac Z. Schlueter**.
- Initially supported only **Linux and macOS**.
- **2011**: **Microsoft and Joyent** added **Windows support**, making Node.js cross-platform.
- **2012**: Ryan left the project; Joyent took over.
- **2014**: A fork named **IO.js** was created.
- **2015**: Node.js and IO.js merged again.
- **2019–Present**: Maintained by the **OpenJS Foundation**, after the Node.js Foundation merged with the JS Foundation.
